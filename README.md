# I Have No Clue...

## Welcome to _I Have No Clue_! One may ask, "Why exactly does this game have such a strange name?" Well, there's quite a simple answer to that. It's because I had absolutely no clue what I was doing when I made this game. I started mashing features together, and here we are. I'm sure I'll work it out some day (including the title)! _I Have No Clue_ is a fairly simple game. You're a gaming console on a desperate mission to reach the illustrious flag. It is the **_only_** thing that can make you happy. Without it, you are lost. Armed with nothing but 4 magical bullets, you must defeat all of the weird spinning blade enemy thingamabobs and **GET TO THAT FLAG!** YOU'VE GOT THIS, SOLDIER!
