# I Have No Clue...

## Welcome to _I Have No Clue_! 
One may ask, "Why exactly does this game have such a strange name?" Well, there's quite a simple answer to that. It's because I had absolutely no clue what I was doing when I made this game. I started mashing features together, and here we are. I'm sure I'll work it out some day (including the title)! _I Have No Clue_ is a fairly simple game. You're a gaming console on a desperate mission to reach the illustrious flag. It is the **_only_** thing that can make you happy. Without it, you are lost (Although you are partially found if you get that key and chest). Armed with nothing but 4 magical bullets, you must defeat all of the weird spinning blade enemy thingamabobs and **GET TO THAT FLAG!** YOU'VE GOT THIS, SOLDIER!

## How 2 Play

### Controls
Controls are split into two sections: the keyboard controls and the XBox 360 controller controls. The game detects if there is a controller plugged in, and if there is, automatically locks its controls to the controller. If there is no controller plugged into the computer, the game defaults to keyboard controls.

#### Keyboard Controls
**Up Arrow** - Jump

**Left Arrow** - Move Left

**Right Arrow** - Move Right

**Spacebar** - Shoot, Begin Game, Restart Game

#### XBox 360 Controller Controls
**Joystick** - Move Left and Right

##### Enemies
There are two types of enemies in the game:

###### Basic Enemies

These enemies will move in one direction until they run into something, in which case they will turn around. However, they do not stay on platforms and instead fall off.

###### Platform Enemies

These enemies move in a similar fashion to the basic enemies, but they stay on platforms and turn around when they reach the edge of a platform.


Both enemy types will damage you on contact, and can be killed by being hit once by a bullet. 
Killing either type of enemy grants you 20 points.

###### Chests

Chests begin each stage in a locked state, and only open once a key has been collected.

Chests and keys are usually in hard-to-reach places that require some form of problem-solving to obtain.

Chests grant 100 points when collected.
